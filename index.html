    <h1>WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <p> I am Xavier Camacho, UX/UI and Graphic designer. I love to make bold designs that would make someone's day and have an impact. 
        My skills include but are not limited to: Adobe Suite, Figma and UX research. I've been a Graphic designer for a sign studio for 
        2 years before deciding to explore the big world of UX Design. </p>
